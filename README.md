🐶 Dogebook is a simple demo app created for a lightning talk at WarsawJS about CSS-in-JS and 💅[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/).

💅[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/) is a great CSS-in-JS library that works out of the box with React, React-Native and Preact 🎉🎉🎉

The purpose of the talk and demo was to demonstrate how quick and flexible styled-components is for building stuff quickly and theming.

Dogebook was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running the app
`yarn install`
`yarn start`
